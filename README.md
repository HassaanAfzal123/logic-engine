# logic-engine
Overview

This repository contains a collection of core computational logic and solution implementations focused on efficient data processing, structured problem decomposition, and optimized execution paths.
The codebase represents foundational building blocks commonly used in performance-critical systems, back-end services, and algorithmic components.

Objectives
Implement core logic patterns used in real-world systems
Focus on efficiency, correctness, and scalability
Maintain clean, modular, and extensible implementations
Serve as a reference layer for structured problem solutions
Each module contains:
Isolated implementations
Clear input/output contracts
Optimized approaches where applicable
Design Principles
Deterministic behavior
Minimal abstractions
Time and space efficiency
Readable and maintainable code
Separation of concerns
Implementation Notes
Solutions prioritize algorithmic efficiency
Multiple approaches may exist for comparison and optimization
Emphasis is placed on edge cases and constraints
Code is written with production-level clarity, not pseudocode

Usage

This repository can be used as:
A core logic reference
A solution layer for larger systems
A testing ground for optimized approaches
A foundation for system-level components

Maintenance

The repository is continuously updated with:
Improved implementations
Refactored logic
Performance enhancements
